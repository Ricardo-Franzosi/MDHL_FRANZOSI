            <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
            <p>
              The common interest that members of the Association share is to
              inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
              play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
              referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
              disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background,
              expertise, accomplishments or standing
            </p>

            <h2>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible
                external field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum
                width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all
                fields used by teams under 12 and older.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the
                competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues,
                districts or associations participating in the state competition
                program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board
                which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
                recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may
                be required to play all their games away.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</strong>

                    a. U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no
                    penalty areas. Fields for older age groups should be
                    progressively larger.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    b. U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30

                  <li>
                    d. In addition, fields used by young age groups may have
                    their internal dimensions and size of goal similarly
                    modified.

                    practice and/or games, and injuries.
